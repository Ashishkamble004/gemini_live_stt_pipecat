**Real-Time Voice-to-Voice AI Assistant built with Google AI services + Pipecat**

![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

This project demonstrates a real-time, voice-to-voice AI assistant using Pipecat's WebSocket transport. It features a Python FastAPI backend and a TypeScript/Vite frontend.

The application captures audio from the user's microphone, streams it to the server for transcription, processes it with a LLM, generates a spoken response with text-to-speech, and streams the audio back to the client for playbackâ€”all in real time.

**Architecture**

The client-side UI captures microphone audio and establishes a WebSocket connection with the Pipecat server. The server manages the real-time pipeline, integrating with third-party AI services for transcription, language modeling, and speech synthesis.

Features
- Real-Time Transcription: Captures user audio and transcribes it live.
- LLM Integration: Processes transcribed text with a configurable large language model.
- Low-Latency Text-to-Speech (TTS): Generates and streams synthesized voice back to the client with minimal delay.
- Voice Cloning: Utilizes voice IDs to generate responses in specific cloned voices.
- Scalable Backend: Built with FastAPI, suitable for production workloads.
- Modern Frontend: Clean user interface built with TypeScript and Vite.
- Cloud-Ready: Includes a complete guide for deploying to Google Cloud Run with Docker and Secret Manager.

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js and npm (v18+)
- Google Cloud SDK - genai
- GCP project API keys for AI services including Gemini.


Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pipecat-websocket-demo.git
cd pipecat-websocket-demo
```

### 2. Configure the Backend

The backend server handles the core AI pipeline.

1.  **Navigate to the server directory:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Copy the example file and add your secret keys.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, edit the `.env` file with your credentials. This is where you'll add your API keys and the voice IDs for voice cloning.

    **.env**
    ```env
    # Example .env file
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path_to_service_account_json_location"

    # Voice IDs from your TTS provider (e.g., ElevenLabs)
    VOICE_ID_FEMALE="path_to_your_female_voice_id"
    VOICE_ID_MALE="path_to_your_male_voice_id"
    ```

### 3. Run the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    Make sure you are in the `server` directory with your virtual environment active.
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:7860`.

2.  **Run the frontend client:**
    Open a **new terminal window**.
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    The client will be accessible at the URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`). Open this URL in your browser to start using the voice assistant.

## Deployment to Google Cloud Run

This project is configured for easy deployment as a single container on Google Cloud Run. The `Dockerfile` builds the frontend assets and serves them from the Python backend.

### 1. Secret Management (Recommended)

Do not hardcode your API keys. Use Google Secret Manager to store them securely.

```bash
# Set your GCP Project ID
export PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
```

### 2. Deploy to Cloud Run

From the root directory of the project, run the following command.
This command builds the container from the Dockerfile and deploys it.
Replace <your-service-name>, <your-region>, and <your-gcp-project> with your specific values.
code

```bash
gcloud run deploy <your-service-name> \
  --source . \
  --platform managed \
  --region <your-region> \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars="GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<your-gcp-project>"
```

Once deployed, Google Cloud will provide a public URL to access your application.
